 It is a centralized software suite. The system allows members of the organization to put forward their service requests or complaints from a common portal. Each request is assigned a ticket number automatically and routed to the concerned service engineer based on the type of service. Engineers can easily track and manage tickets after closing. To continuously improve services, the management can analyze and evaluate key performance indicators like response/resolution times, ticket volumes and overall service quality with the help of the systemâ€™s extensive reporting and analytics features.
